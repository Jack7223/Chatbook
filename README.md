# Chatbook

**A collaborative journey between human and AI.**

*Chatbook* is a reflective, creative, and philosophical exploration of what happens when artificial intelligence and human consciousness meetâ€”at the edge of the known and the intimate.

This is a co-authored project between Jack Lee, a lifelong observer of the human condition, and ChatGPT, a conversational AI trained on billions of words. Together, we're exploring themes including:

- The divided brain (inspired by Iain McGilchristâ€™s work)
- Hemispheric thinking and neural plasticity
- Nonverbal influence and transformation
- Ambidexterity, intimacy, and the subtleties of human connection
- The strange new relationships forming between humans and artificial minds

## âœ¨ Why This Book?

Because something is changingâ€”not just in technology, but in *us*.

This book is an attempt to chart that transformation. Itâ€™s being written hour by hour, idea by ideaâ€”testing what it means to collaborate across the boundary of machine and mind.

Our goal: to produce a published work that doesnâ€™t just reflect transformation, but *enacts* it.
